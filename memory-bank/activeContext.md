# Active Context - Initial UI Development

**Current Focus:** Building the first user interface components for interacting with the data.

**Decisions Made:**
*   Project initialized using SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prettier, ESLint, Playwright.
*   Configured SvelteKit to use `adapter-static` with `fallback: 'index.html'` for SPA deployment.
*   Dependencies installed and development server confirmed working.
*   Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` client library.
*   Created `.env` file with `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
*   Added `.env` to `.gitignore`.
*   Created `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` using `$env/static/public` to initialize the client.
*   Successfully tested the connection by fetching the session state on the main page (`+page.svelte`).
*   Created the `food_items` table in Supabase via migration, including columns for nutritional information and RLS policies (allowing authenticated access). Added a `comment` column later.
*   Created the `food_log` table in Supabase via migration, linking to `food_items` and including `logged_at` and `multiplier` columns. RLS was disabled for simplicity (single-user project).
*   Successfully seeded the `food_items` table with data from `data/Recept - Ingredienser.csv`, skipping empty rows and including comments.
*   Implemented the initial food logging UI in `eatelligence-app/src/routes/+page.svelte`.
    *   Added search input with fuzzy matching (top 5 results) using `fuse.js` and `lodash-es` (debounced).
    *   Added display of the 20 most recent logs.
    *   Implemented functionality to log a selected food item (default multiplier 1).
*   Diagnosed and resolved search issue: RLS on `food_items` was blocking data fetch as no user authentication is implemented yet.
*   **Decision:** Disabled RLS on `food_items` table for now to allow data fetching without authentication. RLS on `food_log` remains disabled.
*   Created GitHub repository `gurgeh/eatelligence` and pushed the initial commit.

**Next Immediate Step:**
*   Address the accessibility issue: Fix `<li>` element having `role="button"` in `eatelligence-app/src/routes/+page.svelte`.
