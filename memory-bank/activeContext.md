# Active Context - Recipe Creation from Log

**Current Focus:** Implementing the ability to create new "recipe" food items by selecting existing entries from the food log.

**Decisions Made:**
*   **Approach:** Decided against using a complex relational structure or JSONB column initially. Instead, recipes will be created as simple snapshots in the `food_items` table based on selected log entries. The nutritional values will be calculated and stored directly on the new recipe item, and the constituent ingredients will be listed in the `comment` field for human readability. This prioritizes simplicity and preserves the immutability of past logs.
*   **UI Workflow:** Created a dedicated page (`/create-recipe`) for this feature instead of cluttering the main log page. A link ("Create Recipe") was added to the main log page (`/`) to navigate to the new route.

**Implementation Details (`/create-recipe/+page.svelte`):**
*   Created the Svelte component `src/routes/create-recipe/+page.svelte`.
*   Added logic to fetch the 100 most recent log entries (similar to the main page, but without pagination for now) including their joined `food_items` data.
*   Implemented UI to display fetched log entries as selectable buttons.
*   Used a `Set<number>` (`selectedLogIds`) to track selected log entry IDs.
*   Implemented `toggleSelection` function to add/remove IDs from the set on button click.
*   Implemented `calculateTotals` function:
    *   Iterates through selected log entries.
    *   Sums the nutritional values (calories, protein, fat, etc.) based on the logged `multiplier` and the base values from the joined `food_items`.
    *   Stores the running totals in a `totals` object.
    *   Rounds calculated totals to one decimal place.
*   Added a display area to show the running nutritional summary for selected items, styled using standard Tailwind utility classes (e.g., `bg-blue-200`, `px-1.5`, `rounded-md`) consistent with the main log page.
*   Added an input field for the user to enter the `recipeName`.
*   Implemented the `createRecipe` async function:
    *   Triggered by the "Create Recipe" button.
    *   Calculates final totals based on the `totals` object.
    *   Generates a multi-line comment string listing the source ingredients and quantities (e.g., "Made from:\n- 1 x 100g Chicken Breast\n- 0.5 x 1 portion Rice").
    *   Prepares a `newFoodItemData` object containing the recipe name, calculated nutritional values, the generated comment, and sets `serving_qty` to 1 and `serving_unit` to "recipe serving".
    *   Inserts this new object as a row into the `food_items` table using `supabase.from('food_items').insert()`.
    *   On success, clears the selection, recipe name, and totals display, showing a success message.
    *   Includes error handling and loading state (`isCreating`).
*   Styled the page elements (input, selection buttons, create button) using standard Tailwind utility classes, removing initial incorrect usage of DaisyUI classes.
*   Resolved accessibility warnings by wrapping list item content in `<button>` elements instead of adding click handlers directly to `<li>`.

**Troubleshooting:**
*   Initially used DaisyUI classes (`btn`, `badge`, `bg-primary`) assuming it was installed, leading to unstyled components on the `/create-recipe` page.
*   Attempted to fix by installing DaisyUI, configuring `tailwind.config.js`, and adding `data-theme` to `app.html`. This did not resolve the issue on the specific page.
*   Investigated CSS processing:
    *   Checked `app.css` and initially removed Tailwind v3 directives (`@import`, `@plugin`), assuming v4 handled it automatically via the Vite plugin. This broke all styling.
    *   Reverted `app.css` to include `@import 'tailwindcss';` and `@plugin '@tailwindcss/forms';`.
    *   Removed DaisyUI package and configuration from `tailwind.config.js` and `app.html`.
    *   Corrected styling on `/create-recipe` page to use standard Tailwind utility classes consistent with `/+page.svelte`.
    *   Resolved Svelte parser errors caused by misplaced comments (`/* ... */` and `<!-- ... -->`) within HTML tags, adhering to the rule in `techstack.md`.
    *   Resolved CSS error "Unknown at rule @plugin" by removing `@plugin '@tailwindcss/forms';` from `app.css` and adding `require('@tailwindcss/forms')` to the `plugins` array in `tailwind.config.js`, aligning with Tailwind v4 practices. Confirmed form styling still works.

**Next Steps:**
*   Proceed with any further requested features or refinements.
