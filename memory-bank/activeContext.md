# Active Context - Initial UI Development

**Current Focus:** Building the first user interface components for interacting with the data.

**Decisions Made:**
*   Project initialized using SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prettier, ESLint, Playwright.
*   Configured SvelteKit to use `adapter-static` with `fallback: 'index.html'` for SPA deployment.
*   Dependencies installed and development server confirmed working.
*   Installed `@supabase/supabase-js` client library.
*   Created `.env` file with `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
*   Added `.env` to `.gitignore`.
*   Created `src/lib/supabaseClient.ts` using `$env/static/public` to initialize the client.
*   Successfully tested the connection by fetching the session state on the main page (`+page.svelte`).
*   Created the `food_items` table in Supabase via migration, including columns for nutritional information and RLS policies (allowing authenticated access). Added a `comment` column later.
*   Created the `food_log` table in Supabase via migration, linking to `food_items` and including `logged_at` and `multiplier` columns. RLS was disabled for simplicity (single-user project).
*   Successfully seeded the `food_items` table with data from `data/Recept - Ingredienser.csv`, skipping empty rows and including comments.
*   Implemented the initial food logging UI in `eatelligence-app/src/routes/+page.svelte`.
    *   Added search input with fuzzy matching (top 5 results) using `fuse.js` and `lodash-es` (debounced).
    *   Added display of the 20 most recent logs.
    *   Implemented functionality to log a selected food item (default multiplier 1).
*   Diagnosed and resolved search issue: RLS on `food_items` was blocking data fetch as no user authentication is implemented yet.
*   **Decision:** Disabled RLS on `food_items` table for now to allow data fetching without authentication. RLS on `food_log` remains disabled.
*   Created GitHub repository `gurgeh/eatelligence` and pushed the initial commit.
*   Fixed accessibility issue in `src/routes/+page.svelte`: Replaced `li` with `role="button"` by nesting a proper `<button>` element inside the `li`. Resolved related Svelte parsing errors caused by comment placement.
*   Implemented inline editing for `multiplier` and `logged_at` in the recent logs list (`src/routes/+page.svelte`).
    *   Logging now defaults `multiplier` to 1 and `logged_at` to the current time.
    *   Users can click directly on the displayed multiplier or timestamp in the recent logs list to edit them.
    *   Input fields appear in place for editing (`text` input for timestamp using `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` format).
    *   Changes are saved automatically on blur or when Enter is pressed. Escape cancels the edit.
    *   Updated timestamp display format (`formatTimestampForDisplay`) to use Swedish locale (`sv-SE`) and 24-hour clock.
    *   Added/updated helper functions for timestamp conversion (`isoToSwedishLocal`, `swedishLocalToIso`).
    *   Added state variables (`editingLogId`, `editingProperty`, `editingValue`) and logic (`startEditing`, `cancelEdit`, `saveLogUpdate`, `handleInputKeydown`, `handleSpanKeydown`) to manage the inline editing flow.
*   Implemented copying logged food items in `src/routes/+page.svelte`.
    *   Added a 'ðŸ“‹' copy button next to the delete button in the recent logs list.
    *   Created a `copyLog` function that inserts a new log entry using the selected log's `food_item_id` and `multiplier`, but sets `logged_at` to the current time.
    *   The recent logs list is refreshed automatically after copying.
*   Added a confirmation dialog (`window.confirm`) to the delete button in the recent logs list (`src/routes/+page.svelte`) to prevent accidental deletions.
*   Updated recent log display format in `src/routes/+page.svelte`:
    *   Reordered elements to: Date - Name - Multiplier | Buttons.
    *   Removed line break after name.
    *   Updated `formatTimestampForDisplay` to show "Today HH:mm" / "Yesterday HH:mm" for recent dates.
    *   Resolved Svelte parsing errors by removing internal comments within the list item structure.
*   Added `max-w-5xl` to the main container `div` in `src/routes/+page.svelte` to limit width on desktop.
*   Implemented nutritional summary display below each log entry in `src/routes/+page.svelte`:
    *   Fetched all required nutritional fields (`calories`, `protein`, `fat`, `carbs`, `fibers`, `sugar`, `mufa`, `pufa`, `sfa`, `gl`) from `food_items` table join.
    *   Added a migration using Supabase MCP to add the missing `gl` column to `food_items`.
    *   Cleared and re-imported data into `food_items` from `Recept - Ingredienser.csv` to populate `gl` values.
    *   Calculated values based on `log.multiplier` and rounded to integers.
    *   Displayed values using styled Tailwind CSS badges (colored backgrounds, padding, rounded corners) for visual grouping, replacing the initial text-based format.

**Next Immediate Step:**
*   Implement a simple overview/summary of the last few days' total nutrition.
